This is the code base for a test destinated to identify the skills of the candidates in Android. The intention is to know the fluidity and knowledge they have with common tasks in a real project, like architecture, design patterns and unit testing.

The recommended time to finish the exercise in approximately one hour. Even when the exercise is very easy, apply as much knowledge as you have respecting the architecture and the technologies already present in the project. There is no need to import more libraries.

The purpose of the project is a CRUD of users. Deletion of users is the missing piece. When doing the exercise keep in mind:

1. **Clean Code**
2. **Readability**
3. **Good architecture control**
3. **Good project handling**
4. **Testing**

It is not necessary to finish all the tests, it is just a way of knowing how the candidate develops in an ongoing project.

**Remember:** Always look for the simplest solution and then try to improve it from there.

Good luck!
